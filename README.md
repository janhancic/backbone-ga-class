# Class materials for 'Web apps with Backbone'

Example code for the class, demonstrating two approches to writing a simple exercise app.

## Running

Designed to be work locally - just open the `.html` files and you're off.

## MVC

A version of the exercise app in Backbone.js, with routing.

## Non-MVC

An unstructed version of the exercise app. No routing.

## Fake XHR

To keep things simple, there is a fake XHR implementation. No servers to run.
